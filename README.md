# Untested
Currently adjusted to be a GCP image for myself - and have not yet tested properly. May not work at this time. WIP

## old readme info

Simple vanilla minecraft image.

You simply need to mount the volume /config and run the image. It will then create the eula.txt and some other files as required, that you can then edit and run again.
